# E2E tests with Page Object Model (POM)

This branch contains the initial documentation and starter scaffold for E2E tests implemented using the Page Object Model (POM).

What this branch includes:
- e2e/README.md (this file) describing the approach and next steps.

Suggested next steps:
1. Add your E2E test framework (Playwright / Cypress / WebDriverIO) configuration to this branch.
2. Create page objects under e2e/pages/ for each page component.
3. Add test specs under e2e/specs/ that use the page objects.
4. Configure CI to run the e2e test suite on pull requests.

Notes:
- Branch created from main.
- This is a starter commit so the branch differs from main and a PR can be opened for review.
